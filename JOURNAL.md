### NVIDIA Apex Integration for SeedVR Performance Optimization |TASK:TASK-2025-01-13-001|
- **What**: Added NVIDIA Apex building and installation to SeedVR-RunPod runtime setup
- **Why**: User requested Apex integration for performance optimization of PyTorch operations in video restoration workloads
- **How**: 
  - Modified Dockerfile to install CUDA toolkit 12.1 with development tools and ninja-build
  - Added step 4.5 to run.sh for Apex repository cloning and building with CUDA extensions
  - Implemented comprehensive error handling with Python-only fallback strategy
  - Updated step numbering from 8 to 9 total steps
- **Issues**: 
  - Base python:3.10-slim image lacks CUDA development tools, required adding full CUDA toolkit (~3GB)
  - Apex compilation can fail in some environments, needed robust error handling
  - Build timing critical - must happen after PyTorch installation but before model setup
- **Result**: 
  - Apex now builds at runtime with CUDA extensions (APEX_CPP_EXT=1 APEX_CUDA_EXT=1)
  - Graceful degradation: Falls back to Python-only build if CUDA compilation fails
  - Container continues to start even if Apex installation completely fails
  - Performance optimizations available when CUDA build succeeds

### Documentation Framework Implementation
- **What**: Implemented Claude Conductor modular documentation system
- **Why**: Improve AI navigation and code maintainability
- **How**: Used `npx claude-conductor` to initialize framework
- **Issues**: None - clean implementation
- **Result**: Documentation framework successfully initialized
