### Fix ModuleNotFoundError in 7B Inference Script |TASK:TASK-2025-08-19-001|
- **What**: Fixed a `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'models'` in the `inference_seedvr2_7b_modified.py` script.
- **Why**: The script was failing because of an unused import statement that was trying to import a non-existent module.
- **How**: Removed the line `from models.dit import na` from the script.
- **Issues**: None.
- **Result**: The inference script for the 7B model can now be executed without a `ModuleNotFoundError`.

### Fix SyntaxError in Inference Scripts |TASK:TASK-2025-08-18-001|
- **What**: Fixed a `SyntaxError: invalid syntax` in the `inference_seedvr2_3b_modified.py` script.
- **Why**: The script would fail to run due to a typo in an argument type definition.
- **How**: Corrected `type=.int` to `type=int` for the `--res_h` argument in the script.
- **Issues**: None.
- **Result**: The inference script for the 3B model can now be executed without syntax errors.

### Refactored Dependency Management
- **What**: Consolidated all Python dependencies into a single `requirements.txt` file.
- **Why**: To resolve version conflicts and prevent environment instability caused by multiple `pip install` commands overwriting packages.
- **How**: Created a `requirements.txt` file with all necessary packages and specific versions. Modified `run.sh` to install dependencies from this file and updated the `Dockerfile` to include it in the container image.
- **Issues**: The initial `git commit` command seemed to hang, but the subsequent `git push` was successful.
- **Result**: A more stable and reproducible build process with unified dependency management.

### SeedVR Containerization for RunPod
- **What**: Containerized the SeedVR project for the RunPod platform.
- **Why**: To create a reproducible and portable environment for running the SeedVR application on RunPod.
- **How**: Created a Dockerfile with a CUDA base image, a run.sh script for runtime dependency installation, a Python script for model downloading, and a Gradio web interface for inference. Also set up a GitHub Action for automated builds and deployments to Docker Hub.
- **Issues**: Encountered missing dependencies for `huggingface_hub` and `gradio`, which were resolved by adding installation steps to the `run.sh` script.
- **Result**: A fully containerized SeedVR application ready for deployment on RunPod.

### Fixed Build Failure
- **What**: Corrected the `apex` installation and removed redundant commands in `run.sh`.
- **Why**: The previous `apex` wheel was incompatible with Python 3.11, causing the build to fail.
- **How**: Replaced the direct wheel installation with a build from the official NVIDIA apex repository. Also removed duplicate `huggingface_hub` installation and `download.py` execution.
- **Issues**: None.
- **Result**: The container build should now complete successfully.

### Fixed GitHub Action Authentication
- **What**: Updated the GitHub Action workflow to use the latest versions of the `actions/checkout`, `docker/login-action`, and `docker/build-push-action`.
- **Why**: The previous versions were causing authentication errors with Docker Hub and using deprecated commands.
- **How**: Changed the version numbers of the actions in the `.github/workflows/main.yml` file.
- **Issues**: None.
- **Result**: The GitHub Action should now authenticate with Docker Hub and run without warnings.

### Corrected Docker Hub Secret Names
- **What**: Updated the GitHub Action workflow to use the correct secret names for Docker Hub authentication.
- **Why**: The workflow was using `DOCKER_USERNAME` and `DOCKER_PASSWORD` instead of `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` and `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`.
- **How**: Changed the secret names in the `.github/workflows/main.yml` file.
- **Issues**: None.
- **Result**: The GitHub Action should now be able to successfully authenticate with Docker Hub.

### Downgraded to Python 3.10
- **What**: Downgraded the Python environment from 3.11 to 3.10.
- **Why**: The `apex` library requires Python 3.10.
- **How**: Updated the `Dockerfile` to install Python 3.10 and the `run.sh` script to use the correct `apex` and `flash-attn` wheels for Python 3.10.
- **Issues**: None.
- **Result**: The container should now build successfully with the correct Python environment and dependencies.

### Fixed Docker Build Failure for Python 3.10
- **What**: Resolved the `E: Unable to locate package python3.10-venv` error during the Docker build.
- **Why**: The Ubuntu 24.04 base image does not have Python 3.10 packages in its default repositories.
- **How**: Modified the `Dockerfile` to add the `deadsnakes` PPA, which is a well-known source for multiple Python versions on Ubuntu. This makes `python3.10` and `python3.10-venv` available for installation.
- **Issues**: None.
- **Result**: The Docker container should now build successfully on GitHub Actions with Python 3.10 correctly installed.
