### NVIDIA Apex Integration for SeedVR Performance Optimization |TASK:TASK-2025-01-13-001|
- **What**: Added NVIDIA Apex building and installation to SeedVR-RunPod runtime setup
- **Why**: User requested Apex integration for performance optimization of PyTorch operations in video restoration workloads
- **How**: 
  - Initially added CUDA toolkit to Dockerfile, but moved to runtime installation due to GitHub Actions build failures
  - Added step 4.5 to run.sh for CUDA toolkit installation and Apex building with CUDA extensions
  - Implemented comprehensive error handling with Python-only fallback strategy
  - Updated step numbering from 8 to 9 total steps
- **Issues**: 
  - Full CUDA toolkit installation (~3GB) caused GitHub Actions build failures (exit code 100)
  - Moved CUDA installation to runtime to fix CI/CD pipeline while maintaining functionality
  - Apex compilation can fail in some environments, needed robust error handling
  - Build timing critical - must happen after PyTorch installation but before model setup
- **Result**: 
  - GitHub Actions builds now succeed without CUDA toolkit bloat
  - CUDA toolkit installs at runtime when needed for Apex compilation
  - Apex builds with CUDA extensions (APEX_CPP_EXT=1 APEX_CUDA_EXT=1) when CUDA available
  - Graceful degradation: Falls back to Python-only build if CUDA compilation fails
  - Container starts successfully even if Apex installation completely fails
  - Performance optimizations available when CUDA build succeeds

### Fix GitHub Actions Build Failure - Runtime CUDA Installation |TASK:TASK-2025-01-13-002|
- **What**: Fixed GitHub Actions build failure caused by CUDA toolkit installation in Dockerfile
- **Why**: GitHub Actions couldn't handle 3GB CUDA toolkit download, causing build to fail with exit code 100
- **How**: 
  - Moved CUDA toolkit installation from Dockerfile to runtime script (run.sh)
  - Added CUDA detection logic to check if nvcc is available before installation
  - Enhanced error handling for both CUDA installation and Apex compilation
  - Maintained backward compatibility with RunPod environments that have pre-installed CUDA
- **Issues**: 
  - GitHub Actions has resource/time limits that prevented large CUDA toolkit download
  - Need to balance CI/CD efficiency with runtime functionality
- **Result**: 
  - GitHub Actions builds now complete successfully
  - Runtime CUDA installation works in both clean and pre-configured environments
  - Maintains all Apex functionality while fixing CI/CD pipeline
  - Reduced Docker image size by ~3GB

### Documentation Framework Implementation
- **What**: Implemented Claude Conductor modular documentation system
- **Why**: Improve AI navigation and code maintainability
- **How**: Used `npx claude-conductor` to initialize framework
- **Issues**: None - clean implementation
- **Result**: Documentation framework successfully initialized
