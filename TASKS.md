# Task Management

## Active Phase
**Phase**: Runtime Optimization & Dependencies
**Started**: 2025-01-13
**Target**: 2025-01-13
**Progress**: 5/5 tasks completed

## Current Task
**Task ID**: TASK-2025-01-13-002
**Title**: Fix GitHub Actions Build Failure - Remove CUDA from Dockerfile
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Started**: 2025-01-13 20:00
**Dependencies**: TASK-2025-01-13-001

### Task Context
<!-- Critical information needed to resume this task -->
- **Previous Work**: GitHub Actions build failing due to CUDA installation in Dockerfile during build phase
- **Key Files**: 
  - `/opt/docker/SeedVR-RunPod/Dockerfile` (lines 9-19): Removed CUDA toolkit installation from build time
  - Previous CUDA installation moved to runtime-only in `run.sh` (already exists)
- **Environment**: GitHub Actions build environment (no GPU access during build)
- **Next Steps**: Task completed - Build now succeeds, CUDA installed at runtime only

### Findings & Decisions
- **FINDING-001**: GitHub Actions build environment cannot install CUDA toolkit during Docker build (no GPU access)
- **DECISION-001**: Removed CUDA toolkit installation from Dockerfile completely → Lightweight build image
- **DECISION-002**: Keep all CUDA installation in runtime setup (run.sh) → Better separation of concerns
- **DECISION-003**: Follow project's runtime-first architecture → All GPU dependencies handled at container startup

### Task Chain
1. ✅ Identify GitHub Actions build failure cause (TASK-2025-01-13-002a)
2. ✅ Remove CUDA toolkit installation from Dockerfile (TASK-2025-01-13-002b)
3. ✅ Verify runtime CUDA installation still intact in run.sh (TASK-2025-01-13-002c)
4. ✅ Update documentation comments in Dockerfile (TASK-2025-01-13-002d)
