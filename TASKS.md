# Task Management

## Active Phase
**Phase**: Runtime Optimization & Dependencies
**Started**: 2025-01-13
**Target**: 2025-01-13
**Progress**: 6/6 tasks completed

## Current Task
**Task ID**: TASK-2025-01-13-008
**Title**: Fix Inference Script Working Directory Issue
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Started**: 2025-08-13 00:05
**Dependencies**: TASK-2025-01-13-007

### Task Context
<!-- Critical information needed to resume this task -->
- **Previous Work**: APEX timeout and file existence fixes completed in TASK-2025-01-13-007, but inference scripts failing to load
- **Key Files**: 
  - `/opt/docker/SeedVR-RunPod/run.sh` (line 168): Added `cd /workspace/SeedVR` before launching Gradio app
  - `/opt/docker/SeedVR-RunPod/app.py` expects relative paths from SeedVR directory
- **Environment**: Container startup complete but inference failing due to wrong working directory when launching Gradio app
- **Next Steps**: Container rebuild and testing required - GitHub Actions will build updated image

### Findings & Decisions
- **FINDING-001**: Gradio app failing to find inference scripts: `projects/inference_seedvr2_3b.py` not found
- **DECISION-001**: Fix working directory issue → Add `cd /workspace/SeedVR` before launching Gradio app
- **FINDING-002**: `app.py` comment indicates it expects to run from `/workspace/SeedVR` directory but was launched from `/workspace`
- **DECISION-002**: Ensure correct working directory → Change to SeedVR directory where `projects/` folder exists before executing app
- **FINDING-003**: ByteDance SeedVR repository confirms inference scripts are in `projects/` directory relative to repo root
- **DECISION-003**: Maintain existing relative paths in app.py → Fix execution context rather than modifying application logic
