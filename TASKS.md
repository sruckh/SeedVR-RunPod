# Task Management

## Active Phase
**Phase**: Runtime Optimization & Dependencies
**Started**: 2025-01-13
**Target**: 2025-01-13
**Progress**: 6/6 tasks completed

## Current Task
**Task ID**: TASK-2025-01-13-004
**Title**: Debug NVIDIA Apex Runtime Installation Execution
**Status**: IN_PROGRESS
**Started**: 2025-01-13 22:15
**Dependencies**: TASK-2025-01-13-003

### Task Context
<!-- Critical information needed to resume this task -->
- **Previous Work**: APEX installation was implemented in run.sh but execution shows step 4.5 being completely skipped
- **Key Files**: 
  - `/opt/docker/SeedVR-RunPod/run.sh` (lines 45-112): Added comprehensive debugging and fixed step numbering
  - Step numbering corrected from inconsistent 4/8‚Üí4.5/9 to proper 4/9‚Üí5/9 sequence
- **Environment**: RunPod container execution showing steps 5/8, 6/8, 7/8, 8/8 instead of expected 6/9, 7/9, 8/9, 9/9
- **Next Steps**: Test container execution to verify CUDA/Apex installation step runs and debugging output appears

### Findings & Decisions
- **FINDING-001**: Step 4.5 (CUDA/Apex installation) completely bypassed during container execution despite being present in run.sh
- **DECISION-001**: Add DEBUG output to identify execution flow and why step is skipped ‚Üí Enhanced run.sh with debugging markers
- **FINDING-002**: Step numbering inconsistency (4/8 jumping to 4.5/9) suggests script execution issues
- **DECISION-002**: Fix step numbering to consistent 4/9‚Üí5/9‚Üí6/9‚Üí7/9‚Üí8/9‚Üí9/9 sequence ‚Üí Corrected all echo statements
- **FINDING-003**: Container shows 8 total steps instead of expected 9 steps, indicating missing step execution
- **DECISION-003**: Add comprehensive DEBUG markers at critical decision points ‚Üí Track nvcc detection, directory checks, Apex cloning

### Task Chain
1. ‚úÖ Restore CUDA toolkit installation to run.sh runtime setup (TASK-2025-01-13-003a)
2. ‚úÖ Enhanced Apex compilation with CUDA detection and fallback (TASK-2025-01-13-003b)
3. ‚úÖ Add comprehensive error handling for both CUDA and Python-only builds (TASK-2025-01-13-003c)
4. ‚úÖ Implement NVIDIA official recommendations for Apex compilation (TASK-2025-01-13-003d)
5. üîÑ Debug why CUDA/Apex installation step is being skipped during execution (CURRENT: TASK-2025-01-13-004a)
6. ‚è≥ Test container execution with debugging output to verify APEX installation (TASK-2025-01-13-004b)
