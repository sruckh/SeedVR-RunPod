# Task Management

## Active Phase
**Phase**: Runtime Optimization & Dependencies
**Started**: 2025-01-13
**Target**: 2025-01-13
**Progress**: 6/6 tasks completed

## Current Task
**Task ID**: TASK-2025-01-13-003
**Title**: Fix Apex CUDA Compilation - Restore Runtime CUDA Installation
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Started**: 2025-01-13 20:30
**Dependencies**: TASK-2025-01-13-002

### Task Context
<!-- Critical information needed to resume this task -->
- **Previous Work**: Apex compilation was broken after removing CUDA from Dockerfile - SeedVR requires Apex for inference
- **Key Files**: 
  - `/opt/docker/SeedVR-RunPod/run.sh` (lines 44-111): Enhanced CUDA installation and Apex compilation
  - CUDA toolkit installation restored to runtime setup with robust error handling
- **Environment**: Runtime container environment with GPU access for CUDA compilation
- **Next Steps**: Task completed - Apex now compiles successfully with CUDA extensions

### Findings & Decisions
- **FINDING-001**: Apex compilation requires CUDA toolkit at runtime, but was missing after Dockerfile fix
- **DECISION-001**: Added CUDA toolkit installation to runtime setup in run.sh → Essential for Apex compilation
- **DECISION-002**: Enhanced Apex build with comprehensive CUDA detection and fallback → Robust compilation
- **DECISION-003**: Follow NVIDIA Apex official recommendations → APEX_CPP_EXT=1 APEX_CUDA_EXT=1 for optimal performance

### Task Chain
1. ✅ Restore CUDA toolkit installation to run.sh runtime setup (TASK-2025-01-13-003a)
2. ✅ Enhanced Apex compilation with CUDA detection and fallback (TASK-2025-01-13-003b)
3. ✅ Add comprehensive error handling for both CUDA and Python-only builds (TASK-2025-01-13-003c)
4. ✅ Implement NVIDIA official recommendations for Apex compilation (TASK-2025-01-13-003d)
